<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Therapeutic Respiratory Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Devices</li><li>Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The therapeutic respiratory equipment market includes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) devices. CPAP devices deliver a steady airflow to keep airways open during sleep, primarily treating obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, BiPAP devices offer two levels of pressure: a higher pressure for inhalation and a lower pressure for exhalation, making them suitable for patients with more complex respiratory issues. Both device types enhance patient comfort and improve respiratory function.</p></p>
