<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractory Bricks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unshaped (Monolithic Refractories)</li><li>Shaped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The refractory bricks market is divided into two primary types: shaped and unshaped (monolithic refractories). Shaped refractories are pre-formed bricks and blocks that include specific designs for various applications, providing structural integrity and thermal efficiency. In contrast, unshaped refractories are flexible mixtures used in installations where shaping on-site is necessary, often applied as castables, bricks, or gunning mixes. Both types are crucial in high-temperature industries, ensuring performance and durability in furnaces, kilns, and reactors.</p></p>
