<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ICP monitors involve techniques like the insertion of a catheter into the brain to directly measure pressure changes, offering accurate real-time data for critical care. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, use external methods, such as imaging or sensors, to assess ICP without penetrating the skull. While invasive options are typically used in severe cases, non-invasive approaches are growing due to their safety and ease of use.</p></p>
